Hi, I'm Evio.  
Right now studying computer science in the Federal Institute of Bras√≠lia at the seventh semester.
Still trying to figure out my objective field in computer science.

I probably spend more time playing video games than i should. But a big part of my knowledge about technology or foreign languages, joke point, came from that interest in games, so i'm happy about it.
